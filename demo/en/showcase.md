This article explains how to integrate [umami](https://umami.is/) analytics into your blog or website for free. The database used is a limited [postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), but the free 500M is already enough for [umami](https://umami.is/).

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted using [vercel](https://vercel.com/). Thanks to the excellent service capabilities of today's cloud providers, you can integrate *umami* in 10 minutes. You can click [Analytics Dashboard](https://umami-ochre-nu.vercel.app/share/o3zAba1V/guangzhengli) to see the final effect.

## Create Database

The database used is a limited [postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [supabase](https://app.supabase.com/). Create a supabase account, create a new project, and enter the Database password to create the database service.

Creating may take a few minutes, and once created, you only need to get the `DATABASE_URL`.

## Host Umami

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted using [vercel](https://vercel.com/). After creating the database instance, you can deploy the umami service with one click through Vercel. Visit the [Running on Vercel](https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel) module in the [umami official documentation](https://umami.is/) for instructions and a one-click deployment script.

First, log in to your GitHub account and `fork` the umami (https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project.

Log in to [vercel](https://vercel.com/), create an account, and it is recommended to register and log in using your GitHub account. In `new project`, select `import` the project you just `forked`.

Then fill in the environment variables. Here we need to fill in two environment variables:

* DATABASE_URL: The DATABASE_URL obtained when creating the database
* TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME: The default `tracker_script_name` may cause some `AdBlock` to block requests, losing some access data, so I filled in `hugo-ladder`.

Finally, in the Build stage, remember to fill in `build command` with `yarn build && yarn update-db`, so it will automatically migrate the database tables. No need to import manually.

Of course, if you want to import it yourself, you can also get the required tables directly from here https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql.

## Configure Umami

After deploying umami on vercel, you will get a `<deploy-id>.vercel.app`. Visit it, and the default account password is **admin** and **umami**.

After completing the basic account configuration, click the website Tab on the sidebar and click Add Website. Fill in the basic information of the website, and you can check `enable share URL`, so anyone can access this analytics dashboard.

We get the corresponding `data-website-id` and `src`, and fill in `params.analytics.umami.website_id` and `params.analytics.umami.url` in the theme configuration.

### Step 2: Reflection

1. **Difficult to Understand Statements:**
   - "The database used is a limited postgres provided by supabase, but the free 500M is already enough for umami." - This sentence could be clearer about what "500M" refers to.
   - "The default tracker_script_name may cause some AdBlock to block requests, losing some access data, so I filled in hugo-ladder." - This could be simplified for better understanding.

2. **Preservation Issues of Original Markdown Elements:**
   - All images, headings, and links have been preserved correctly.
   - The code blocks and inline code elements are also correctly maintained.

3. **Missed Elements:**
   - No elements were missed in the translation.
