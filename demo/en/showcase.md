This article explains how to integrate [umami](https://umami.is/) analytics into your blog or website for free. The database used is a limited [Postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), but the free 500MB is more than enough for [umami](https://umami.is/).

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Thanks to the excellent service capabilities of today's cloud providers, you can integrate *umami* in just 10 minutes. You can click [Analytics Dashboard](https://umami-ochre-nu.vercel.app/share/o3zAba1V/guangzhengli) to see the final result.

## Creating the Database

The database used is a limited [Postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/). Create a Supabase account, start a new project, and enter the Database password to create the database service.

It may take a few minutes to create, and once it's done, you just need to get the `DATABASE_URL`.

## Hosting Umami

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). After creating the database instance, you can deploy the umami service with one click via Vercel. Visit the [Running on Vercel](https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel) section of the [umami official documentation](https://umami.is/) for instructions and a one-click deployment script.

First, log in to your GitHub account and `fork` the umami (https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project.

Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), create an account (it's recommended to use your GitHub account), and in `new project`, select `import` for the project you just `forked`.

Next, fill in the environment variables. We need to fill in two environment variables here:

* DATABASE_URL: The DATABASE_URL obtained when creating the database
* TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME: The default `tracker_script_name` might be blocked by some `AdBlock` tools, causing some data loss. So here, I used `hugo-ladder`.

Finally, in the Build phase, remember to fill in the `build command` as `yarn build && yarn update-db`, so the database tables will be automatically migrated. No need to import them manually.

Of course, if you want to import them manually, you can get the required tables directly from here: https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql.

## Configuring Umami

After deploying umami on Vercel, you will get a `<deploy-id>.vercel.app`. Visit it, and the default username and password are **admin** and **umami**.

After completing the basic account setup, click the Websites tab on the sidebar and add a new website. Fill in the basic information and you can check `enable share URL` so anyone can access this analytics dashboard.

Get the corresponding `data-website-id` and `src`, and fill them into the theme configuration under `params.analytics.umami.website_id` and `params.analytics.umami.url`.
