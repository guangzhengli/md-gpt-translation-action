This article explains how to integrate [umami](https://umami.is/) analytics into your blog or website for free. The database used is a limited [postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), but the free 500M is already enough for [umami](https://umami.is/).

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/). Thanks to the excellent service capabilities of today's cloud providers, you can integrate *umami* in 10 minutes. You can click [Analytics Dashboard](https://umami-ochre-nu.vercel.app/share/o3zAba1V/guangzhengli) to see the final effect.

## Create Database

The database used is a limited [postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [supabase](https://app.supabase.com/). Create a supabase account, create a new project, and enter the Database password to create the database service.

It may take a few minutes to create, and once created, you only need to get the `DATABASE_URL`.

## Host Umami

The [umami](https://umami.is/) service is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/). After creating the database instance, you can deploy the umami service with one click through Vercel. Visit the [Running on Vercel](https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel) module in the [umami official documentation](https://umami.is/) for instructions and a one-click deployment script.

First, log in to your GitHub account and `fork` the umami (https://github.com/umami-software/umami) project.

Log in to [vercel](https://vercel.com/), create an account, it is recommended to register and log in using your GitHub account, and select `import` for the project you just `forked` in `new project`.

Then fill in the environment variables, here we need to fill in two environment variables:

* DATABASE_URL: The DATABASE_URL obtained when creating the database
* TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME: The default `tracker_script_name` may cause some `AdBlock` to block requests, losing some access data, so I filled in `hugo-ladder`.

Finally, in the Build stage, remember to fill in `yarn build && yarn update-db` for the `build command`, so that the database tables will be automatically migrated. No need to import manually.

Of course, if you want to import manually, you can also get the required tables directly from here https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql.

## Configure Umami

After deploying umami on vercel, you will get a `<deploy-id>.vercel.app`, visit it, the default account and password are **admin** and **umami**.

After completing the basic account configuration, click the website Tab on the sidebar, and click Add Website. Fill in the basic information of the website, you can check `enable share URL`, so that anyone can access this analytics dashboard.

We get the corresponding `data-website-id` and `src`, and fill in `params.analytics.umami.website_id` and `params.analytics.umami.url` in the theme configuration.

Finally, we can get the analytics dashboard function for this site ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Step 2: Reflection on Direct Translation

1. **Difficult to Understand Statements:**
   - The phrase "limited [postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) provided by [supabase](https://app.supabase.com/)" might be confusing. It could be clearer if we specify that it is a free tier with a 500MB limit.
   - The term "tracker_script_name" might not be immediately clear to all readers. It could benefit from a brief explanation.
   - The phrase "automatically migrate the database tables" might be too technical. Simplifying it to "automatically set up the database" could be better.

2. **Markdown Elements:**
   - All images and links have been preserved correctly.
   - Headings and code blocks are intact.

### Step 3: Reinterpretation for Clarity and Readability

This article explains how to integrate [umami](https://umami.is/) analytics into your blog or website for free. We'll use a free-tier [Postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database) database provided by [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), which offers 500MB of storageâ€”more than enough for [umami](https://umami.is/).

We'll host the [umami](https://umami.is/) service on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Thanks to the excellent services provided by modern cloud platforms, you can integrate *umami* in just 10 minutes.

* TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME: The default `tracker_script_name` might be blocked by some `AdBlock` extensions, causing loss of some data. So, I used `hugo-ladder`.

Finally, in the Build stage, set the `build command` to `yarn build && yarn update-db`. This will automatically set up the database tables for you.

If you prefer to set up the tables manually, you can get the required SQL script from here: https://github.com/umami-software/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.postgresql.sql.

## Configure Umami

After deploying umami on Vercel, you'll get a URL like `<deploy-id>.vercel.app`. Visit this URL; the default username and password are **admin** and **umami**.

After setting up the basic account, click the website tab on the sidebar and add your website. Fill in the basic information and check `enable share URL` so anyone can access the analytics dashboard.

You'll get a `data-website-id` and `src`. Fill these into `params.analytics.umami.website_id` and `params.analytics.umami.url` in your theme configuration.

Finally, you'll have a fully functional analytics dashboard for your site ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
